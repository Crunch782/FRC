# FRC

FRC is a MATLAB code for solving a Mixing Optimization Problem. 

The Navier-Stokes solver is based on the solver presented in 'An Introduction to Scientific Computing' by Danaila, I., Joly, P., Kaber, S.M., Postel, M. 

The Optimization algorithm is based on the code used in Foures et. al 2012;

The Adjoint Equations are solved in an analogous manner to the Direct Equations.
