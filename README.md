# FRC

FRC is a MATLAB code for solving Mixing Optimization Problems in a 2D Box with Toroidal Geometry.

The Navier-Stokes solver is a modified version of the solver presented in 'An Introduction to Scientific Computing' by Danaila, I., Joly, P., Kaber, S.M., Postel, M.  

The Optimization Algorithm and some of the functions used are based on the code used in Foures et. al 2012, published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics;
